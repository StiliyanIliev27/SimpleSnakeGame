# SimpleSnakeGame
This is my first basic snake game created with CSharp! The reason I created the game was to reminisce about the good old times and, of course, to put into practice the knowledge I've accumulated so far from SoftUni. 
It has simple functionality - you can move only in 4 directions with keyboard arrows. Up, down, left and right.
I have also created 2 stats which are displayed on the console - current level and food points (experience).
The game has 3 types of food for now - dollar, hash and asterisk. The hash gives you 3 points, the dollar gives you 2 points and the asterisk gives you 1 point.
Every 5 points gathered the level increases by 1.
I hope you like it and enjoy your playing!
